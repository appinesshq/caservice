## About this repo

This repo is a reimplemented version of the API service of Ardan Lab's [Ultimate Service class](https://education.ardanlabs.com), following Clean Architecture and Clean Code principles.

The approach of this project is to completely reimplement the service instead of refactoring the original service. Allthough this service uses the principles of Clean Architecture, we highly recommend Ardan Lab's course.
